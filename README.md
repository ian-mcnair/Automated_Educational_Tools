# Automated_Educational_Tools
Contains my ideas, designs, and rough implementations of educational tools that could potentially help teachers.

Not much here yet!

## Current Ideas

### 1. Short Response Answer Clustering
The idea here is to use machine learning to group similar student answers. Student responses can be vectorized/OHE/embedded and grouped together, allowing the teacher to grade similar responses more fairly. This also will allow the teacher to provide more detailed feedback.

### 2. Short Response Answer Similarity
An extension of the above. This takes takes a set of answers deemed "correct" and compares them to other unlabeled answers. A similarity score is calculated. The idea of this is that it is a stepping stone towards automatically grading short response questions based on how similar to the set of correct answers. Ideally, as a teacher uses this method, the number of accepted answers grows, increasing the generalizability of the model/method/algorithm

### 3. Long Paper Metrics
Grading a paper, like a history or english paper, for content and correctness is pretty difficult. Pulling out metrics however is very possible. The goal here is to have a paper graded in two ways, for technical level and correctness. The algorithm could check sentence structure, sentence complexity, and even use educational theory to check writing level. With that out the way, a teacher could focus specifically on evaluating the content of the paper and not worry about grading technical ability. More research should be done in this area however!

### 4. Content Focused Chatbot
This would allow students to ask questions when teachers are not available. It would be an expert in the topic area (up to a certain level) to help students better understand misconceptions. Using the idea of common ground, misconceptions could then also be delivered to the teacher based on responses by students.
